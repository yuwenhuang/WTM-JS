# Let's eat!
This is my practice project for WTM-Berlin JavaScript Course

My idea comes from 2 use cases
1. Party preparation: People want to throw a party and ask each participant to bring some food,
usually we do so by using WhatsApp or messanger to discuss and all the information are mix together. It is a mess! And in the end we discover no one bring any main dish and we can only eat chips and drink beers(maybe also good). So I want users can use this website to add what food he/she is going to bring and make a good plan for their parties!

2. Food sharing: share the food people don't need

So far I just use the technologies we learn from WTM-Berlin JavaScript Course and will continue to apply more...

TODO
1. combine with OAuth, provide OAuth login funciton and get real user data
2. build a frontend  (in another repository) by using REACT framework
    - interactive forms for users: input prompt and check
3. figure out how to combine my 2 use cases to present a good user interface
