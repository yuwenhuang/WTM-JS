# WTM-JS Project
My idea comes from 2 use cases
1. Party preparation
People want to throw a party and ask each participant to bring some food
user can use this website to add what food he/she is going to bring
2. Food sharing

So far I just use the technologies we learn from WTM-Berlin JavaScript Course

TODO
1. combine OAuth to get real user data
2. build a frontend  (in another repository) by using REACH framework
    - interacitive forms for user :input check
