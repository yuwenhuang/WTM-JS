# WTM-JS Project
My idea comes from 2 use cases
1. Party preparation: People want to throw a party and ask each participant to bring some food
user can use this website to add what food he/she is going to bring
2. Food sharing: share the food I don't need

So far I just use the technologies we learn from WTM-Berlin JavaScript Course and will continue to apply more...

TODO
1. combine with OAuth, provide OAuth login funciton and get real user data
2. build a frontend  (in another repository) by using REACH framework
    - interactive forms for users: input prompt and check
